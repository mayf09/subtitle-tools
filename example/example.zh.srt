Alright, I want to start by laying out some of the goals of the course.

2
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:15,260
所以，首先是了解操作系统的设计和实现。
So, number one is to understand design and implementation of operating systems.

3
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:24,530
是的，设计是一种高层次的结构，而实现实际上是关于代码看起来的样子，
Yeah, design is sort of high level structure and implementation is really about what the code looks like,

4
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:26,480
我们会花很多时间在这两方面。
and we'll be spend a lot of time with both.

5
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:33,380
为了深入了解发生的事情，
And in the interest of getting deep understanding of what's going on,

6
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:44,700
你将亲身体验一个小型的操作系统， xv6 操作系统。
you'll get hands on experience with a small, with a small operating system, the xv6 operating system.

7
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:50,230
除了查看现有的操作系统之外，
And in addition to actually looking at an existing operating system,

8
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:54,610
你会在实验里积累很多经验，
that you'll be in the labs get a bunch of experience,

9
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:58,030
通过扩展操作系统、修改、改进其行为，
extending the operating system, modifying, improving its behavior

10
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:04,780
以及编写使用操作系统接口的系统软件，[]应用程序。
and writing system software that it uses the operating system interfaces, [] application.
