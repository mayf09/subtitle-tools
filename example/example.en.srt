00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:05,670
Alright, I want to start by laying out some of the goals of the course.

2
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:15,260
So, number one is to understand design and implementation of operating systems.

3
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:24,530
Yeah, design is sort of high level structure and implementation is really about what the code looks like,

4
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:26,480
and we'll be spend a lot of time with both.

5
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:33,380
And in the interest of getting deep understanding of what's going on,

6
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:44,700
you'll get hands on experience with a small, with a small operating system, the xv6 operating system.

7
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:50,230
And in addition to actually looking at an existing operating system,

8
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:54,610
that you'll be in the labs get a bunch of experience,

9
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:58,030
extending the operating system, modifying, improving its behavior

10
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:04,780
and writing system software that it uses the operating system interfaces, [] application.
